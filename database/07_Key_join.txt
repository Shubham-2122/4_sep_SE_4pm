Primary key and foreign key example and query fire in table relationship data show
ChatGPT said:
Let’s go step–by–step 👇

🧩 1. Create Two Tables with Primary and Foreign Keys
We'll take an example of Departments and Employees.

➤ Table 1: Departments
Each department has a unique ID — this is the Primary Key.

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50)
);
➤ Table 2: Employees
Each employee belongs to one department — this uses a Foreign Key.

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)
);
🧠 2. Insert Sample Data
INSERT INTO Departments (dept_id, dept_name)
VALUES (1, 'HR'), (2, 'Sales'), (3, 'IT');

INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, emp_name, salary, dept_id)
VALUES
(101, 'John', 50000, 1),
(102, 'Ravi', 55000, 2),
(103, 'Neha', 60000, 3),
(104, 'Sita', 52000, 1);
🔍 3. View Individual Tables
SELECT * FROM Departments;
SELECT * FROM Employees;
🔗 4. Join Tables (Show Relationship Data)
Use an INNER JOIN to show which employee belongs to which department:

SELECT 
    e.emp_id,
    e.emp_name,
    e.salary,
    d.dept_name
FROM 
    Employees e
INNER JOIN 
    Departments d
ON 
    e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
✅ Result:

emp_id	emp_name	salary	dept_name
101	John	50000	HR
102	Ravi	55000	Sales
103	Neha	60000	IT
104	Sita	52000	HR
🧾 5. Optional – Show Employees Without Departments
(If some employees don’t have a department yet)

SELECT 
    e.emp_id, e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM 
    Employees e
LEFT JOIN 
    Departments d
ON 
    e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
Would you like me to also show how to update or delete data while keeping the relationship (foreign key constraint) valid?

Would you like me to also include a FULL JOIN example (shows all matching and non-matching rows from both tables)?

You said:
Any another query apply for this time
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! There are many other SQL queries you can apply on these tables to analyze the relationship between Employee and Department. Here’s a list of useful examples in pure SQL:

1️⃣ Count Employees in Each Department
SELECT 
    d.DeptName,
    COUNT(e.EmpID) AS EmployeeCount
FROM 
    Department d
LEFT JOIN 
    Employee e
ON 
    d.DeptID = e.DeptID
GROUP BY 
    d.DeptName;
2️⃣ Show Employees With Salary Greater Than 50000
SELECT 
    EmpName,
    Salary,
    DeptID
FROM 
    Employee
WHERE 
    Salary > 50000;
3️⃣ Find Department With Highest Paid Employee
SELECT 
    e.EmpName,
    e.Salary,
    d.DeptName
FROM 
    Employee e
INNER JOIN 
    Department d
ON 
    e.DeptID = d.DeptID
ORDER BY 
    e.Salary DESC
LIMIT 1;
4️⃣ List Employees Without Department
SELECT 
    EmpID,
    EmpName,
    Salary
FROM 
    Employee
WHERE 
    DeptID IS NULL;
5️⃣ Update Employee Department
UPDATE Employee
SET DeptID = 4
WHERE EmpName = 'Amit';
6️⃣ Delete Employee
DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE EmpID = 105;
7️⃣ Sum of Salaries Per Department
SELECT 
    d.DeptName,
    SUM(e.Salary) AS TotalSalary
FROM 
    Department d
LEFT JOIN 
    Employee e
ON 
    d.DeptID = e.DeptID
GROUP BY 
    d.DeptName;
If you want, I can make a full list of 20+ SQL queries for Primary & Foreign Key relationships that you can just run on these tables.

Do you want me to do that?

This example can we convert student and teachers 
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! We can convert the same example to Students and Teachers. Here’s the pure SQL version for a similar relationship:

One teacher can have many students (so TeacherID is Primary Key in Teachers and Foreign Key in Students).

-- Create Teachers table (Primary Key)
CREATE TABLE Teachers (
    TeacherID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    TeacherName VARCHAR(50),
    Subject VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create Students table (Foreign Key)
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    TeacherID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (TeacherID) REFERENCES Teachers(TeacherID)
);

-- Insert data into Teachers table
INSERT INTO Teachers (TeacherID, TeacherName, Subject) VALUES
(1, 'Mr. Sharma', 'Math'),
(2, 'Ms. Gupta', 'Science'),
(3, 'Mr. Verma', 'English');

-- Insert data into Students table
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, StudentName, Age, TeacherID) VALUES
(101, 'Ravi', 15, 1),
(102, 'Neha', 16, 2),
(103, 'Amit', 15, 1),
(104, 'Sita', 16, 3),
(105, 'Anjali', 15, NULL);  -- Student without teacher yet

-- View tables
SELECT * FROM Teachers;
SELECT * FROM Students;

-- INNER JOIN: Show students with their teachers
SELECT 
    s.StudentID,
    s.StudentName,
    s.Age,
    t.TeacherName,
    t.Subject
FROM 
    Students s
INNER JOIN 
    Teachers t
ON 
    s.TeacherID = t.TeacherID;

-- LEFT JOIN: Show all students, even if no teacher assigned
SELECT 
    s.StudentID,
    s.StudentName,
    s.Age,
    t.TeacherName,
    t.Subject
FROM 
    Students s
LEFT JOIN 
    Teachers t
ON 
    s.TeacherID = t.TeacherID;

-- RIGHT JOIN: Show all teachers, even if they have no students
SELECT 
    s.StudentID,
    s.StudentName,
    s.Age,
    t.TeacherName,
    t.Subject
FROM 
    Students s
RIGHT JOIN 
    Teachers t
ON 
    s.TeacherID = t.TeacherID;

-- Count of students per teacher
SELECT 
    t.TeacherName,
    COUNT(s.StudentID) AS StudentCount
FROM 
    Teachers t
LEFT JOIN 
    Students s
ON 
    t.TeacherID = s.TeacherID
GROUP BY 
    t.TeacherName;

-- List students without a teacher
SELECT 
    StudentID,
    StudentName,
    Age
FROM 
    Students
WHERE TeacherID IS NULL;
If you want, I can also create 20+ more queries like salary sum, max/min age, update teacher assignment, delete student, etc., all in the Student–Teacher scenario.

Do you want me to do that?
